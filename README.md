This is a template to generate both base and event pixel for TikTok on GTM. In order to get the event part working, we have to "install" first the base pixel.

When this is done, we can create our pixel events. TikTok only allows (at the moment I write this) to insert the standard events that they've created. Besides that, custom parameters can be added, but you have to follow the guidelines marked on [this documentation](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10028). Keep in mind that you will only be able to send parameters on the events that are marked there (AddPaymentInfo, CompletePayment, PlaceAnOrder, Search and ViewContent).
